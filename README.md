A how to train your dragon chatbot

1. Clone the Repository
If you havenâ€™t already, clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:

git clone <repository-url>

Then, navigate into the project directory:

cd <repository-folder>

2. Navigate to the src Directory
Your Java source files are in the src folder, so move there:

cd src

3. Compile the Java Files
Since you have multiple Java files, compile them together:

javac Chatbot.java User.java

This generates .class files for each Java source file.

4. Run the Program
Once compiled, run the main class:

java Chatbot
